ThunkTS was built as a coding exercise in developing software architecture for a modular system.

The code contains a game logic engine, as well as a simple ASCII implementation of the game.

Instructions for playing are provided in game. Simply run ThunkTS.cpp to begin.

Feel free to edit makeBoard() in Board.cpp to define new game scenerios. The current game engine loop requires exactly two player entities, but is otherwise robust.

New entity logic can be defined by creating new subclasses in Entity.cpp.
